## Introduction

The Hypered design system is a collection of components, templates, and other
bits of HTML and CSS to create a unified user experience across Hypered
projects. It also contains non-web implementations, such as LaTeX templates.

See the README file in the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/hypered/design) for additional information.

## Content

The initial design work was done in Next.js. It made it possible to create
re-usable snippets of HTML show-cased in Storybook. Two pages to introduce the
design system were also created, with the addition of an error page. The CSS
part was done using Tachyons.

That work generates files in the `docs/` directory of the repository, which is
exposed using GitHub Pages at [js.hypered.design](https://js.hypered.design).

- [Landing page](https://js.hypered.design/landing/) - An initial landing page
  for the design system itself.
- [Components page](https://js.hypered.design/components/) - A similar page to
  the landing page, to give an overview of the available components.
- [404 page](https://js.hypered.design/404/) - An error page using CSS
  animations.
- [Components (Storybook)](https://js.hypered.design/storybook/) - A
  Storybook-based page to explore all the components.

There is an attempt at creating an implementation of the design system using
the ITCSS approach. Only a single page exists for now. This is also manually
created within the `docs/` directory.

- [ITCSS example page](https://js.hypered.design/static-binaries.html) - This
  page should match an [existing
  page](https://noteed.com/notes/static-binaries.html).

The rest is built using Nix and served from a VM at this domain
([hypered.design](https://hypered.design)).

The main usage of the design system is within applications written in Haskell.
Examples generated with the Haskell code are also available:

- [Haskell examples](hs/) - Everything that exist in the original
  implementation also exist here.
