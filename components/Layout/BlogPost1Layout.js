        <P>
	  If you consider adopting a programming language, consider one where
          you can create statically-linked executables. This makes things so much
          easier.

        <H2>E.g., compared to Docker</H2>

        <P>
	  With a statically-linked binary, provisioning a program on a remote
          host is just uploading it. With Docker, you need to install and
          maintain docker-engine. Ideally you should have a nice way to provision
          the remote host with Docker, but then, why not use that nice way to
          provision other stuff directly ?
        </P>

        <P>
	  Docker is much more than packaging, but it seems a lot of people use
          it for that purpose.
        </P>

        <P>
	  By the way, statically-linked executables make building Docker images
          a breeze.
        </P>

        <P>
	  If you use Docker to deploy, you probably want a private registry,
          which is another piece to maintain. Static binaries are trivial to host
          on a static site. Or to mirror. And so on. Simplicity goes a long way.
