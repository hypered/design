A version of ../../firefox-vm made to create screenshots of Struct pages.

This really should be part of this repository although I need to check if using
its nixpkgs still results in the exact same rendering.

The goal is to create images of the Struct pages so it's possible to refactor
the code and make sure it still looks the same.
